Radio-Meshnet

Description of the Goals of our Radio Meshnet Project
This Project aims to Create a Mesh Network in our Region and eventually expanding it into wherever People will live by then.

We chose Reticulum as our Mesh Network Protocol Stack And we also need libremesh/openwrt for the Wifi parts of the Network. We work on impelmentations of the Mesh Software and want to make it easy to establish Hardware for use in our Meshnetwork. We plan to use Lora,cb,wifi and possibly more Radio Technologies and Hardware. There are some tasks ahead in order that we can start connecting devices we need all the componets and softwares to work together This project aims on delivering solutions to the missing parts and setting up the mesh Network for daily use of our Members. We also work on our own Android Application for our Members. This Project Repo is for tracking our progress.
