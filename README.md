## Overview and scope of the project 'Radio Meshnet', that is funded by NLnet Foundation (nlnet.nl).

The aim of the project is the development and testing of a self-sustained radio mesh-network based on free radio standards like LoRa, Wifi, CB, PMR under reallife conditions to allow communities to communicate and transact economically in emergency situations and independent of the electricity grid and the internet. Therefore, suitable hardware and software technology is to be found, used, refined and developed, the theoretical planning of such networks is to be transferred to reality and the function and reliability is to be tested and optimized with large amounts of participants over long distances. 

In the first step, a messenger app ("Communicator") and the necessary wireless hardware for LoRadio / WLAN / CB / PMR must be developed 
for the selected meshnetwork protocol [Reticulum](https://www.reticulum.network) from Mark Qvist. 

In step two, the actual project goal is sought. 

With a large number of willing users and provided hardware/software, a mesh-network is created and the runtimes as well as the message loss will be recorded and statistically evaluated. 

As a result, an assessment of the feasibility of real autonomous networks is to be carried out, which could lead to the subsequent successful implementation of an extensive emergency communication network, possibly Europe-wide. 

In this network users will be self-identified with modern SSI/DID technology, to safely communicate and exchange information, goods and services to make it possible to survive in disaster situations with mutual help. 

Therefore, part of the project is the possible integration of a low bandwidth tolerant blockchain into the network. 
This has never really been implemented at the moment. Suitable blockchains such as beam, mina etc. are to be examined for this purpose.

If you have questions or want to join the effort, please contact us via [Email](radio-meshnet@proton.me) and leave us a Message.
We appreciate external help and have made a Repo for tracking those issues.

There you`ll find suggestions on things that need to be made in order to let our meshnetwork conquer the world.
